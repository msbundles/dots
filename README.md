# dots.py
Dots is a Python script that launches a Python controlled Firefox instance and uses that to interact with my p5js project named [Dot Drawer](https://msbundles.github.io/Bundles-Personal-Programming-Betterment/p5/1-Dots/). And feel free to fork this and add your own functionality, and don't forget to make a pull request.
